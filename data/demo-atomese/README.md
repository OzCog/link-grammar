Demo Atomese dictionary
-----------------------
This is an example configuration for an AtomSpace-backed dictionary. It
is used to specify the connection to a running CogServer. The CogServer
must contain apprporiate language data, in the expected format. See the
[dict-atomese README](../../link-grammar/dict-atomese/README.md) for
more info.

This dictionary is currently experimental, and subject to change at any
time.

Edit the `cogserver.cfg` file and specify the CogServer URL.
