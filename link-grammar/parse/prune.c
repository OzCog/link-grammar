  The algorithms in this file prune disjuncts from the disjunct list
  of the sentence that can be eliminated by a simple checks.  The first
  check works as follows:

  A series of passes are made through the sentence, alternating
  left-to-right and right-to-left.  Consider the left-to-right pass (the
  other is symmetric).  A set S of connectors is maintained (initialized
  to be empty).  Now the disjuncts of the current word are processed.
  If a given disjunct's left pointing connectors have the property that
  at least one of them has no connector in S to which it can be matched,
  then that disjunct is deleted. Now the set S is augmented by the right
  connectors of the remaining disjuncts of that word.  This completes
  one word.  The process continues through the words from left to right.
  Alternate passes are made until no disjunct is deleted.

  It worries me a little that if there are some really huge disjuncts lists,
  then this process will probably do nothing.  (This fear turns out to be
  unfounded.)

  Notes:  Power pruning will not work if applied before generating the
  "and" disjuncts.  This is because certain of it's tricks don't work.
  Think about this, and finish this note later....
  Also, currently I use the standard connector match procedure instead
  of the pruning one, since I know power pruning will not be used before
  and generation.  Replace this to allow power pruning to work before
  generating and disjuncts.

  Currently it seems that normal pruning, power pruning, and generation,
  pruning, and power pruning (after "and" generation) and parsing take
  about the same amount of time.  This is why doing power pruning before
  "and" generation might be a very good idea.

  New idea:  Suppose all the disjuncts of a word have a connector of type
  c pointing to the right.  And further, suppose that there is exactly one
  word to its right containing that type of connector pointing to the left.
  Then all the other disjuncts on the latter word can be deleted.
  (This situation is created by the processing of "either...or", and by
  the extra disjuncts added to a "," neighboring a conjunction.)

*/

/*
  Here is what you've been waiting for: POWER-PRUNE

  The kinds of constraints it checks for are the following:

	1) successive connectors on the same disjunct have to go to
	   nearer and nearer words.

	2) two deep connectors cannot attach to each other
	   (A connectors is deep if it is not the first in its list; it
	   is shallow if it is the first in its list; it is deepest if it
	   is the last on its list.)

	3) on two adjacent words, a pair of connectors can be used
	   only if they're the deepest ones on their disjuncts

	4) on two non-adjacent words, a pair of connectors can be used only
	   if not [both of them are the deepest].

   The data structure consists of a pair of hash tables on every word.
   Each bucket of a hash table has a list of pointers to connectors.
   These nodes also store if the chosen connector is shallow.
*/
/*
   As with normal pruning, we make alternate left->right and right->left
   passes.  In the R->L pass, when we're on a word w, we make use of
   all the left-pointing hash tables on the words to the right of w.
   After the pruning on this word, we build the left-pointing hash table
   this word.  This guarantees idempotence of the pass -- after doing an
   L->R, doing another would change nothing.

   Each connector has an integer c_word field.  This refers to the closest
   word that it could be connected to.  These are initially determined by
   how deep the connector is.  For example, a deepest connector can connect
   to the neighboring word, so its c_word field is w+1 (w-1 if this is a left
   pointing connector).  It's neighboring shallow connector has a c_word
   value of w+2, etc.

   The pruning process adjusts these c_word values as it goes along,
   accumulating information about any way of linking this sentence.
   The pruning process stops only after no disjunct is deleted and no
   c_word values change.

   The difference between RUTHLESS and GENTLE power pruning is simply
   that GENTLE uses the deletable region array, and RUTHLESS does not.
   So we can get the effect of these two different methods simply by
   always ensuring that deletable[][] has been defined.  With nothing
   deletable, this is equivalent to RUTHLESS.   --DS, 7/97

/* ===================================================================
   PP Pruning (original comments from version 3 - some not up to date).

   The "contains one" post-processing constraints give us a new way to
   prune.  Suppose there's a rule that says "a group that contains foo
   must contain a bar or a baz."  Here foo, bar, and baz are connector
   types.  foo is the trigger link, bar and baz are called the criterion
   links.  If, after considering the disjuncts we find that there is is
   a foo, but neither a bar, nor a baz, then we can eliminate the disjunct
   containing bar.

   Things are actually a bit more complex, because of the matching rules
   and subscripts.  The problem is that post-processing deals with link
   names, while at this point all we have to work with is connector
   names.  Consider the foo part.  Consider a connector C.  When does
   foo match C for our purposes?  It matches it if every possible link
   name L (that can result from C being at one end of that link) results
   in post_process_match(foo,L) being true.  Suppose foo contains a "*".
   Then there is no C that has this property.  This is because the *s in
   C may be replaced by some other subscripts in the construction of L.
   And the non-* chars in L will not post_process_match the * in foo.

   So let's assume that foo has no *.  Now the result we want is simply
   given by post_process_match(foo, C).  Proof: L is the same as C but
   with some *s replaced by some other letters.  Since foo contains no *
   the replacement in C of some * by some other letter could change
   post_process_match from FALSE to TRUE, but not vice versa.  Therefore
   it's conservative to use this test.

   For the criterion parts, we need to determine if there is a
   collection of connectors C1, C2,... such that by combining them you
   can get a link name L that post_process_matches bar or baz.  Here's a
   way to do this.  Say bar="Xabc".  Then we see if there are connector
   names that post_process_match "Xa##", "X#b#", and "X##c".  They must
   all be there in order for it to be possible to create a link name
   "Xabc".  A "*" in the criterion part is a little different.  In this
   case we can simply skip the * (treat it like an upper case letter)
   for this purpose.  So if bar="X*ab" then we look for "X*#b" and
   "X*a#".  (The * in this case could be treated the same as another
   subscript without breaking it.)  Note also that it's only necessary
   to find a way to match one of the many criterion links that may be in
   the rule.  If none can match, then we can delete the disjunct
   containing C.

   Here's how we're going to implement this.  We'll maintain a multiset
   of connector names.  We'll represent them in a hash table, where the
   hash function uses only the upper case letters of the connector name.
   We'll insert all the connectors into the multiset.  The multiset will
   support the operation of deletion (probably simplest to just
   decrement the count).  Here's the algorithm.

   Insert all the connectors into M.

   While the previous pass caused a count to go to 0 do:
	  For each connector C do
		 For each rule R do
			if C is a trigger for R and the criterion links
			of the rule cannot be satisfied by the connectors in
			M, Then:
			   We delete C's disjunct.  But before we do,
			   we remove all the connectors of this disjunct
			   from the multiset.  Keep tabs on whether or not
			   any of the counts went to 0.



	Efficiency hacks to be added later:
		Note for a given rule can become less and less satisfiable.
		That is, rule_satisfiable(r) for a given rule r can change from
		TRUE to FALSE, but not vice versa.  So once it's FALSE, we can just
		remember that.

		Consider the effect of a pass p on the set of rules that are
		satisfiable.  Suppose this set does not change.  Then pass p+1
		will do nothing.  This is true even if pass p caused some
		disjuncts to be deleted.  (This observation will only obviate
		the need for the last pass.)
